# Digital Signal Processing Data and Examples

## Overview

Digital signal processing(DSP) involves applying mathematical and computational algorithms to discrete-time signals for quality improvement and information extraction. It has been widely used in the applications such as signal augmentation, data compression, anomaly detection, object recognition, economic forecasting, equipment condition monitoring, industrial control, and many others.

SAS offers digital signal processing tools to users through SAS Event Stream Processing (ESP), SAS/IML, and SAS Visual Forecasting (VF). This project contains data that is used SAS documenation, tutorial, or blogs for demonstrating the usage of SAS DSP tools. The project also contains example code on appplying the SAS DSP tools to real world applications. 


## Installation

Before downloading the example code, please make sure the product for running the code (SAS Event Stream Processing, or SAS/IML, or SAS Visual Forecasting) is installed.
